### HOW THE GAME WORKS
First you decide how many players will participate in the game (between 2 and 9)
Then every player is dealt their hand and they need to decide wether to raise their base bet of 1 chip, fold or call another player's raise
The way a winner of a game is decided is by scoring each player's hand
The main combinations are Three of a kind, which gives 3 times the score the card gives (except for 7 which gives 34), Three of the same colour (works the same way but the cards are added up instead of multiplied), 2 of a kind and a 7 of clubs gives 
2 times the repeating cards and adds an 11 to said score, two repeating colours and a seven of spades gives the first cad + the second card + 11 for the seven, a high card and a seven of spades gives the high card's score + 11 for the seven and if you have none of 
these combinations your hand has a score of the card with the highest score. If two players have the same score then the game is a draw and those players fight for the pot with the players who lost the hand being given the option to join them, but having to pay
half of the pot to enter. The game is over when all players except 1 are left without any chips, with the remaning player being crowned the winner. If after a game you decide to stop playing your progress will be saved and you can continue your game another time.
